This is our first visit to Scoop new empire & we have tried some of the items from their Ramadan menu which started from today, they are :
-
1. Zuccini Fries
2. Korean Chicken Wings
3. French Toast
4. Thai Kebab
5. Thai Noodles
6. Peanut and Tofu Bowl meal
7. Banoffee pie
8. Rose Thandai Milkshake
-
We are really surprised to see their menu which is huge like more than 200 items they serve & after tasting the food we realized that we have been missing out some of the best food served in Kolkata
We highly recommend everyone to visit Scoop New Empire
