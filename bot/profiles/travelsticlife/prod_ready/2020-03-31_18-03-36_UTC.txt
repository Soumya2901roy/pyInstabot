A special moment of gratitude the other night in #NewYorkCity 👏🏽 As the sun began to set over #NewYork the city’s spirit came to life with a round of applause for the incredible health care workers & emergency responders who are putting others first as we battle #COVID19. 🌇Moments like this show the true character of people in this great city. #StayHome #ClapBecauseWeCare #BeautifulDestinations (📸: @tomjauncey 📍: New York City)
