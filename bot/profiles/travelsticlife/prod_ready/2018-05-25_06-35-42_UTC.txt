We encounter the best people and the best stories in our childhood. #whatsyourstory

I happened to attend #bioscopewala's special screening last weekend and the movie was revolving around such a beautiful story which takes one back to their childhood. It's an adaption of Rabindranath Tagore's Kabuliwala & mostly shot in Kolkata which brings out the true essence of our city.

It releases this week, it's a must watch for people of Kolkata.
