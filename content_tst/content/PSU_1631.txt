Dear Ex Now that you're gone, | want you to know one thing.
I know I loved you with every breath of mine, with all my
heart & yet I failed to keep you forever.

But when I move on with someone, which I know I surely
will, the piece of you in me, it'll vanish. | wont keep it forever
even tho you made me who l am today (a better person).

I will never want my present love questioning her love for
me, thinking she failed as a lover just because | wasn't
strong enough to move over you. wi

No one deserves to be put thinking that they aren't enough
for someone to even tho they give it all. So, if someone falls
for me, I'll fall for her putting it all behind. I really wish you
were strong enough too, to put your past behind & loved me
for who I was.
